# Graduate-Admission-Prediction

To apply for a master's degree is a very expensive and intensive work. With this kernel, students will guess their capacities and they will decide whether to apply for a master's degree or not.

So, basically this set is about the Graduate Admissions data i.e. Given a set of standardized scores like GRE, TOEFL, SOP standard scores, LOR standard scores, what is probability ( basically i have done a YES/NO scenario ) of gaining admission into a particular school. All those folks who are preparing for MS, might point out this question, from where did you get SOP & LOR scores. These arenâ€™t public figures ? I mean yes, it might not be public, but dont you think universities might be grading these applications on some scale of rating so that the scores can be standardized. Hence the SOP, LOR scores.
